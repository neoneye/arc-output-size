# Predicting the output size of an ARC task

[Video explanation](https://youtu.be/u-A8IpVhMns)

Using the command line tool [loda-rust](https://github.com/loda-lang/loda-rust) for making guesses about the output size.


# Dataset - ARC

```
count_tasks: 800  The number of tasks processed.
count_ok_predictions: 745  Predictions that matches with the actual data.
count_bad_predictions: 4  Predictions that are different than the actual data.
count_cannot_predict: 51  Unable to make a prediction. Insufficient data, lack of algorithms for predicting.
count_other_errors: 0  Something went wrong.
count_same_size: 532  Number of tasks where input size and output size are the same.
```

# Dataset - Concept ARC

```
count_tasks: 176  The number of tasks processed.
count_ok_predictions: 142  Predictions that matches with the actual data.
count_bad_predictions: 7  Predictions that are different than the actual data.
count_cannot_predict: 27  Unable to make a prediction. Insufficient data, lack of algorithms for predicting.
count_other_errors: 0  Something went wrong.
count_same_size: 130  Number of tasks where input size and output size are the same.
```

# Dataset - 1D-ARC

There is no prediction going on.

```
count_tasks: 901  The number of tasks processed.
count_ok_predictions: 901  Predictions that matches with the actual data.
count_bad_predictions: 0  Predictions that are different than the actual data.
count_cannot_predict: 0  Unable to make a prediction. Insufficient data, lack of algorithms for predicting.
count_other_errors: 0  Something went wrong.
count_same_size: 901  Number of tasks where input size and output size are the same.
```


# Dataset - Mini ARC

There is no prediction going on.

```
count_tasks: 149  The number of tasks processed.
count_ok_predictions: 149  Predictions that matches with the actual data.

count_cannot_predict: 0  Unable to make a prediction. Insufficient data, lack of algorithms for predicting.
count_other_errors: 0  Something went wrong.
count_same_size: 149  Number of tasks where input size and output size are the same.
